# AI-Driven Decision Making in Business Analytics (AUTOML):


## PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This project demonstrates how Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) can leverage Automated Machine Learning (AUTOML) to make accurate, data-driven business decisions.  

The system automates data preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and prediction using  TPOT and  PYCARET, delivered through an interactive StreamLit web application


## OBJECTIVES

•	Automate the end-to-end machine learning pipeline

•	Reduce manual effort in model selection and tuning

•	Enable non-technical users to build predictive models

•	Support business decision-making through analytics


## SETUP AND USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

This project demonstrates how SMEs can leverage Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) tools like TPOT and PyCaret to make informed business decisions through predictive analytics. 

Follow the steps below to set up and explore the AutoML-based app using Streamlit and Python.


## KEY FEATURES

•	Automated Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

•	Feature engineering & preprocessing

•	AutoML-based model comparison & selection

•	Model evaluation (Accuracy, F1-score, AUC, Confusion Matrix)

•	Hyperparameter tuning

•	Ensemble learning (bagging, boosting, stacking)

•	Model export (.pkl) for deployment

•	Instant predictions using uploaded test data
